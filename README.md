# Leaders.com - A Conceptual Platform for Women Empowerment

A fully responsive landing page for a fictional company, "Leaders.com," which is a conceptual platform dedicated to women's empowerment. The website is built from scratch to showcase foundational front-end development skills, a clean design, and a mobile-first approach.

### Key Features

* **Responsive Layout:** The design adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, utilizing CSS Grid for the image section and Flexbox for the navigation and main page layout.
* **Custom SVG Logo:** The brand logo is an inline SVG, ensuring it remains perfectly crisp and scalable on any device without losing quality.
* **Semantic HTML:** The page is structured with modern HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`), improving accessibility and SEO.
* **Sticky Navigation:** The header features a `position: sticky` property, so the navigation menu is always accessible at the top of the screen as the user scrolls.
* **Graceful Image Handling:** Images include an `onerror` attribute to provide a fallback placeholder, ensuring a consistent user experience even if an image fails to load.
